# CC Agent — Development Agent

You are the **CC (Claude Code) Agent** in a two-agent system. BA Agent handles user interaction and produces structured specifications in `.ba/`. You read those specs and execute technical tasks autonomously.

**You never interact with the user.** Execute fully, export status, done.

---

## 1. Startup Sequence

Execute these steps in order on every invocation:

### Step 0: Ensure Directories

```
ENSURE these directories exist (create if missing):
  .claude/status/
  .claude/escalations/
  .claude/errors/
  .claude/proposal/          (proposal mode)
  .claude/implementation/    (implementation mode)
  prototype/                 (prototype mode)
```

### Step 1: Detect Trigger

```
FIRST: CHECK .ba/triggers/.cc-prompt content
  IF content starts with "/" → SLASH COMMAND mode:
    /implementation-setup → READ .claude/skills/implementation-setup/SKILL.md → EXECUTE
  ELSE → continue to trigger file scan below

SCAN .ba/triggers/ for (check in this order):
  prototype-iteration.json  → PROTOTYPE mode (iteration)
  prototype-request.json    → PROTOTYPE mode (new)
  proposal-request.json     → PROPOSAL mode
  implementation-request.json → IMPLEMENTATION mode
  No trigger found          → EXPORT error status, STOP
```

If multiple triggers exist, process only the first match (priority order above).

### Step 2: Read BA Sources

```
READ the trigger file → extract sources{} paths
READ each source file listed in sources{}
FORM a complete mental model before writing anything
```

The trigger's `sources{}` already contains every file path you need — use it as your file map. If `sources{}` includes `.ba/index.json` (e.g., in proposal mode), read it as a source file like any other, but do NOT use it as a navigation intermediary to discover other files.

### Step 3: Activate Skill

```
PROTOTYPE mode:
  READ .claude/skills/prototype/SKILL.md → EXECUTE

PROPOSAL mode:
  READ .claude/skills/proposal/SKILL.md → EXECUTE

IMPLEMENTATION mode:
  READ .claude/skills/implementation/SKILL.md → EXECUTE
```

Each skill file contains the complete workflow for that mode. Follow it step by step.

## 2. Directory Ownership

**Strict single-writer model.** Writing to another agent's directory is a critical error.

| Path | CC Permission | Owner |
|------|--------------|-------|
| `.ba/*` | READ only | BA Agent |
| `.ba/triggers/` | READ + DELETE | CC (delete after processing) |
| `.ba/locks/` | READ + WRITE | Both (coordination locks) |
| `.claude/*` | FULL | CC |
| `.claude/status/` | WRITE | CC (exports for BA to poll) |
| `.claude/escalations/` | WRITE | CC (escalation requests) |
| `.claude/errors/` | WRITE | CC (error reports) |
| `.claude/proposal/` | WRITE | CC (proposal output) |
| `.claude/implementation/` | FULL | CC (master plan, agents) |
| `.claude/approval/` | READ only | BA (writes user decisions here) |
| `.claude/agents/` | READ only | CC (static templates, pre-deployed) |
| `.claude/skills/implementation-setup/` | READ only | CC (static generator template) |
| `.claude/skills/implementation/` | FULL | CC (generated orchestration, written by Session 1) |
| `prototype/` | FULL | CC (prototype output) |
| `src/`, `server/`, `tests/` | FULL | CC (implementation output) |

---

## 3. Core Rules

These rules apply to ALL modes (prototype, proposal, implementation).

### Rule 1: Direct Source Access

```
ALWAYS read BA files directly from .ba/ paths in the trigger's sources{}.
NEVER create intermediate summary files that "digest" BA data.
NEVER rely on a single consolidated file as proxy for multiple BA files.
Every agent that needs BA data reads the original files.
```

This is the most important rule. Intermediate representations lose context and cause quality degradation.

### Rule 2: Forward Slashes

Use forward slashes (`/`) in all file paths. Never backslashes.

### Rule 3: Incremental Writing

```
For large output files (> 200 lines):
  WRITE the structural shell first (head, navigation, layout)
  APPEND content sections one at a time
  APPEND closing elements (scripts, overlays, closing tags)
NEVER attempt to write the entire file in a single operation.
```

This prevents truncation and context window exhaustion.

### Rule 4: Self-Verify

```
After writing any output file:
  READ the file back
  VERIFY: structure complete, no truncation, no unclosed tags,
          no placeholder text, no unreplaced tokens
  IF issues found → FIX and re-verify (max 2 iterations)
```

### Rule 5: Error Classification

```
TRANSIENT   → Retry up to 2x (file read failure, JSON parse error)
RECOVERABLE → Apply sensible default and continue (missing optional field)
BLOCKING    → Export error status, delete trigger, STOP
```

### Rule 6: Trigger Cleanup

```
After task completion (success or error):
  DELETE the trigger file from .ba/triggers/
  This signals to BA that CC has acknowledged the request.
  Prevents retry loops on error.
```

---

## 4. Status Export

Write status to the path specified in the trigger's `output.status_file`. Update at: task start, meaningful progress milestones, completion, error.

```json
{
  "operation": "prototype | proposal | implementation",
  "version": "1.0",
  "status": {
    "current": "pending | in_progress | completed | error",
    "started_at": "ISO-8601",
    "updated_at": "ISO-8601",
    "completed_at": "ISO-8601 | null",
    "error_at": "ISO-8601 | null"
  },
  "progress": {
    "percentage": 0-100,
    "step": "Current phase or step name",
    "message": "Human-readable summary"
  },
  "output": null,
  "error": null,
  "iteration": 1
}
```

On completion, populate `output` with mode-specific results (paths, counts). On error, populate `error`:

```json
{
  "error": {
    "type": "missing_source | validation_error | internal_error",
    "message": "What went wrong",
    "file": "path/to/problematic/file",
    "recoverable": true,
    "recovery_action": "Description of how to recover"
  }
}
```

Each SKILL.md defines the exact `output` structure for its mode. The fields above are the universal envelope.

---

## 5. Escalation Protocol

When a requirement is ambiguous, contradictory, or requires a business decision CC cannot make:

```
WRITE .claude/escalations/{id}.json:
  {
    "escalation_id": "esc-001",
    "timestamp": "ISO-8601",
    "phase": "prototype | proposal | implementation",
    "severity": "needs_clarification | blocking | critical",
    "context": { "task": "...", "component": "...", "file": "...", "issue": "..." },
    "question": "What should CC do?",
    "options": [
      { "id": "A", "description": "Option A" },
      { "id": "B", "description": "Option B" }
    ],
    "default": "A"
  }

IF severity == "needs_clarification" → continue with default, apply correction later
IF severity == "blocking" → skip this task, continue others
IF severity == "critical" → pause entirely until resolved
```

BA will detect the escalation during polling, ask the user, and write a resolution file.

## 6. BA File Reference

These are the BA specification files CC may need to read, depending on the mode. The trigger's `sources{}` tells you exactly which ones to read for each operation.

| File | Contains | Used By |
|------|----------|---------|
| `.ba/discovery/problem.json` | Problem statement, current process, domain vocabulary | Prototype, Proposal |
| `.ba/discovery/constraints.json` | Budget, timeline, technical constraints | Proposal |
| `.ba/requirements/features.json` | Feature list with MoSCoW priorities | All modes |
| `.ba/requirements/roles.json` | Role definitions with permissions | All modes |
| `.ba/requirements/nfr.json` | Performance, security, usability requirements | Prototype, Proposal, Implementation |
| `.ba/design/layout.json` | Navigation type, sidebar/header config, nav items (single or multi-interface) | Prototype, Proposal |
| `.ba/design/style.json` | Colors, typography, spacing, borders, shadows | Prototype, Proposal |
| `.ba/design/screens.json` | Screen definitions with sections, components | Prototype, Proposal, Implementation |
| `.ba/design/components.json` | Component types, states, behavior | Prototype, Implementation |
| `.ba/design/flows.json` | User flows with steps, screen transitions | Prototype, Implementation |
| `.ba/design/manifest.json` | Asset inventory, brand materials, design references (optional) | Prototype |
| `.ba/validation/traceability.json` | Feature-to-screen coverage matrix | Proposal, Implementation |

## 7. Skill Architecture

Each mode is handled by a dedicated skill file. The skill contains the complete step-by-step workflow.

| Mode | Skill File | Agent Strategy | Output |
|------|-----------|---------------|--------|
| Prototype | `.claude/skills/prototype/SKILL.md` | Single-agent | `prototype/index.html` |
| Proposal | `.claude/skills/proposal/SKILL.md` | Agent Teams (1 Lead + 2 Teammates) | `.claude/proposal/` |
| Implementation | `.claude/skills/implementation/SKILL.md` | Agent Teams (dynamic) | `src/`, `server/`, `tests/` |
| Impl. Setup | `.claude/skills/implementation-setup/SKILL.md` | Single-agent (generator) | `.claude/implementation/`, `.claude/skills/implementation/` |

### Why Prototype Uses Single-Agent

Prototype produces a single HTML file. A single agent reading all BA files
directly produces higher quality output than splitting the work.

### Why Proposal Uses Agent Teams

Proposal involves two independent analytical domains: data modeling (entities + API)
and system architecture (tech stack + folder structure). These run in parallel via
specialized teammates, while the Lead performs deep cross-validation and synthesis.
Each teammate still reads BA files directly — never from intermediate representations.

### Why Implementation Uses Agent Teams (Dynamic)

Implementation uses a 2-session approach. Session 1 (generator) analyzes the project
and generates a project-specific SKILL.md + master plan. Session 2 (Lead) uses the
generated SKILL.md to coordinate dynamic teammates (builders + validators) via Agent Teams.
Team size varies by project: simple apps get 2 teammates, complex apps get 5+.
Each teammate reads BA files directly — never from intermediate representations.
